### apathy-musl 1.1
*apathy musl* is a pure 64 bit linux distribution built from scratch, using the `musl libc` instead of the traditional `glibc`.

this is the second release of apathy-musl. 1.0 being built by following documentation written by *dslm4515* which had old packages, sloppy/prone to fail writing and differences in choice of software. after writing my own build guide with [apathy-mlfs](https://github.com/mssx86/apathy-mlfs), i have continued building the system, resulting in this repo.

extensively detailed documentatiton about building the base system can be found at [apathy-mlfs](https://github.com/mssx86/apathy-mlfs) repo. once you're finished with the installation of the base system, the rest of the system can be built with the help of `void` and `alpine`/`adelie` repositories. also, there are toolchain tarballs if one wants to jump straight into building the base without going through the building steps of cross-toolchain and the toolchain.
