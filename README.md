## apathy gnu/linux 1.2
apathy *(formerly known as mssLinux)* is a pure 64 bit gnu+linux distribution aiming to be minimalistic while not crippling the user's ability to smoothly do their computing. it is built from scratch by following the *linux from scratch 8.4* book as its base.

this is the third *release* of apathy, 1.0 being my first attempt to build an lfs system. it was fairly *bloated* as i didn't fine tune dependencies so i wanted to give it a second try, which gave birth to 1.1. 1.1 was supposed to be tidier, more minimalistic and also have multilib support for `steam` and `wine` but it got out of hand fairly quick due to me not being experienced enough with a multilib toolchain so that idea got scrapped, resulting in 1.2.

because it is intended to be the way i document my progress and keep everything in one place, this repository does not include a build script or an installer but if desired, following the lfs 8.4 book and then building the software listed under `pkg-management/packages.md` in the same order using the configs and patches under `pkg-management/build-configs` would result in an exact copy of this system.
