### apathy-musl 1.1
*apathy musl* is a pure 64 bit linux distribution built from scratch, utilizing musl libc, aiming to be clutter free without crippling the user.

this is the second release of apathy-musl, `1.0` being built by following the documentation written by [dslm4515](https://github.com/dslm4515). after contributing to their project, i forked their work and rewrote it from scratch using a cleaner documentation style, updated packages, a different init system and with a set of different choices in software, resulting in `1.1`.

if one wants to build the base that `apathy-musl` uses, documentation is readily available at [apathy-mlfs](https://github.com/mssx86/apathy-mlfs) repository. it includes an already working toolchain for people that wants to pass the building of the toolchain and the cross-toolchain steps and jump straight into building their system.

once the base is done, you can read `APKBUILDS` from alpine linux repositories for instructions and use this repository or void linux' package search function to find patches required for building software using `musl`. gentoo is fairly handy when it comes to finding `libressl` patches as well.

an existing irc channel on freenode can be found at `#apathy-linux` if one wants to interact with the maintainer/only user of the project.
