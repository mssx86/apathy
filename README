apathy
======
apathy is a linux "distribution" (lol) built from scratch using apathy-mlfs as
its base (https://github.com/mssx86/apathy-mlfs) for the sake of having
something to do, though it barely resembles it in its current stage.

like all the meme distributions, it utilizes musl as the libc. rest of the
system is composed of whatever i felt like putting in there, with the gaps
filled with busybox applets where possible, without creating a scenario of
cripplement for the sake of muh minimalism. behind, there also is an (almost)
intelligent in-house init system written in posix shell.

because it is intended for my use only, apathy does not have an image to boot
from or a stage{1..4} tarball to unpack. i take weekly backups with literally
clonezilla so if they're gone, apathy is gone. objectively speaking, you would
not want to use it anyway.
