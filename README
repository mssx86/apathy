apathy
======
apathy is a linux "distribution" (lol) built from scratch using apathy-mlfs as
its base (https://github.com/mssx86/apathy-mlfs) for the sake of having
something to do, though it's more like a linux of thesus at this point.

like all the meme distributions, it utilizes musl as the libc. rest of the
system is composed of whatever i felt like putting in there, with the gaps
filled with busybox applets where possible, without creating a scenario of
cripplement for the sake of muh minimalism. behind, there also is an (almost)
intelligent in-house init system written in posix shell.

because it is intended for my use only, apathy does not have an image to boot
from or a stage{1..4} tarball to unpack. i take weekly backups with literally
clonezilla so if they're gone, apathy is gone. objectively speaking, you would
not want to use it anyway.
