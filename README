apathy is a linux """distribution""" built on top of a heavily modified version
of apathy-mlfs, which can be found at https://github.com/mssx86/apathy-mlfs, for
the sake of having something to do. it uses musl libc, openssl, partially
busybox and a home-brewed init structure written in posix shell.

because it is intended for my use only, this repository does not contain an
image to boot from or a stage3 tarball to unpack. you wouldn't want to use it
anyway.
