apathy
======
apathy is a linux "distribution" (lol) built from scratch for the sake of having
something to do. it initially got started off of github.com/mssx86/apathy-mlfs
but a lot have changed gradually and none of the recipes from mlfs are used
anymore.

like all the meme distributions, apathy utilizes musl as the libc and the rest
of the system is composed of whatever i felt like putting in with the gaps
filled with busybox applets where possible, though without creating a scenario
where the user experience is crippled for the sake of muh minimalism. there also
is an in-house init system written in posix shell.

because apathy is intended for my use only, this repo does not contain an image
to boot from or a stage{1..4} tarball to unpack. objectively speaking, you would
not want to use it anyway.
